# FACE_EXP_CNN
This repository is a collection of my works related to analysing human facial expressions via the lens of Deep Neural Networks

## Expect updates here soon:

A convolutional neural network on its process of identifying HAPPY faces! The gradient class activation maps from several intermediate layers shows you how the DCNN collects the necessary features as the layers progresses.
